# Pinterest-pin-scraping

### Introduction

Pinterest is a visual discovery engine for finding ideas such as recipes, home and style inspiration, and more. Each idea is represented by a "pin" that includes an image, a description, and a link back to the image's source online where users can learn more about the idea. Pinterest uses a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, and Go, to power its machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities.



### Objective

●	Recognize the working of Pinterest Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for Pin recommendation.

●	Extract data from the website and perform analysis.

●	Learn about different functions of the Pinterest library in Python.



### Results and Discussions

●	The Discovery team provides recommendations, related content, and predicts the likelihood that a person will Pin content.

●	The PinSage neural network is used to make recommendations relevant.

●	The unofficial Pinterest API implemented in Python can perform various tasks like commenting, pinning, re-pinning, following, and unfollowing.

●	The project demonstrates the process of Pinterest's recommendation system through various Python libraries and computes user similarities.
